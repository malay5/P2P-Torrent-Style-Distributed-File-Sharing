# 🔷 Distributed Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System

A **robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing framework** implemented in **C/C++**.
The system uses **TCP-based socket communication**, **multi-threading**, and **system-level constructs** to enable high-throughput, verified, and distributed file exchange among peers.

The architecture is designed around **multi-tracker coordination**, **chunk-level parallelism**, and **integrity validation**, ensuring consistent availability and strong resilience to node and tracker failures.

---

## 📘 Abstract

This project presents a hybrid P2P model combining centralized metadata management with decentralized file distribution.
Trackers maintain global metadata, while peers directly exchange file segments.
The system supports:

* Secure user and group authentication
* Multi-source parallel downloads
* SHA1-based integrity validation
* On-demand serving of file pieces
* Multi-tracker metadata synchronization

The result is a **high-availability distributed system** suitable for real-world file sharing scenarios.

---

## ✔️ Key Features

### 1️⃣ Secure User Authentication Layer

* User credentials hashed using **SHA1**.
* Tracker-managed session lifecycle.
* Prevents unauthorized access to shared resources.

---

### 2️⃣ Group-Based Access Control

* Logical separation of shared content via groups.
* Group admins manage membership requests.
* Strong permission enforcement for file visibility and sharing.

---

### 3️⃣ Distributed File Sharing Workflow

* Files split into **512 KB chunks** for efficient distribution.
* Users upload file metadata (path + per-chunk hashes) to the tracker.
* Peers download chunks concurrently from multiple sources.
* Immediate re-sharing of downloaded chunks promotes decentralization.

App-level guarantees include:

✔ High transfer speeds
✔ Load distribution across peers
✔ Successful reconstruction with verified integrity

---

### 4️⃣ Load-Aware Piece Selection Algorithm

* Dynamically computes peer load.
* Prioritizes chunk download from least-loaded peers.
* Avoids network hotspots and increases overall throughput.

---

### 5️⃣ Multi-Tracker Robustness

* Multiple trackers operate in parallel.
* Continuous metadata synchronization through TCP.
* Auto-recovery and full resync when a tracker rejoins after downtime.
* Provides strong fault tolerance and high system availability.

---

### 6️⃣ Multi-Threaded Peer Engine

Each client node internally spawns:

* A **server thread** to serve chunk requests.
* Multiple **worker threads** for parallel chunk downloads.
* Independent communication handlers for both peer and tracker modules.

This ensures scalability under heavy workloads and minimizes transfer latency.

## ⚙️ Build & Execution

### ▶️ Run Trackers

```bash
make
./tracker tracker_info.txt <tracker_id>

# Example:
./tracker tracker_info.txt 1
```

`tracker_info.txt` specifies the IP and port of each tracker.

---

### ▶️ Run Clients

```bash
make
./client <IP>:<PORT> tracker_info.txt

# Example:
./client 127.0.0.1:6000 tracker_info.txt
```
